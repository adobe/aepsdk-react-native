> [!NOTE]   
> Since version 5.0.0 of the Adobe React Native SDK, all React Native libraries that share the same major version are compatible with each other.

> [!NOTE]  
> The React Native libraries within this repository are specifically designed to support the Android and iOS platforms only.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Adobe React Native SDK utilizes the React Native interop layer to ensure compatibility with new architecture.

## Requirements 

- React Native

Requires React Native (0.60.0 and above)

- Xcode

To submit iOS apps to the App Store, you must build them using Xcode 15 or later, as required by [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/).

## iOS Privacy Manifest

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Adobe Experience Platform React Native **6.x** libraries now depend on Experience Platform iOS 5.x SDKs, which have been updated to align with Apple's latest guidelines on [privacy manifest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files). For further details on how Apple's privacy-related announcements affect the Adobe mobile SDK for iOS, please refer to this [document](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/resources/privacy-manifest/).

## Expo Support

Please refer to the [Expo Integration](./docs/expo.md) document for guidance on integrating the SDK with Expo projects.

## Installation

You need to install Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages and configure the native Android/iOS project in your React Native project.

> Note: If you are new to React Native, we suggest you follow the [React Native Getting Started](https://reactnative.dev) page before continuing.

### Install AEP npm packages

Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK packages can be installed from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) command.

> Note: `@adobe/react-native-aepcore` is required to be installed.

Install the `@adobe/react-native-aep{extension}` package:

```bash
cd MyReactApp
npm install @adobe/react-native-aep{extension}
```

Alternatively, include the Adobe Experience Platform npm packages as dependencies in the appâ€™s package.json.

The following code snippet shows for Mobile Core and Edge Network extensions as an example in package.json:

```bash
...
"dependencies": {
    "react-native": "0.72.5",
    "@adobe/react-native-aepcore": "^7.0.0", //core is required and includes aepcore, aepsignal, aeplifecycle, aepidentity libraries
    "@adobe/react-native-aepedge": "^7.0.0",
    "@adobe/react-native-aepedgeidentity": "^7.0.0",
    "@adobe/react-native-aepedgeconsent": "^7.0.0",
...
},
```

Inside of the app directory, run

```bash
#if using node package manager
npm install
```

or

```bash
#if using yarn package manager
yarn install
```

##### ios development

For iOS development, after installing the plugins from npm, download the pod dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

To update native dependencies to latest available versions, run the following command:

```bash
cd ios && pod update && cd ..
```

## Initializing

Then, initialize the SDK using the following methods:
- [MobileCore.initializeWithAppId(appId)](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-react-native/tree/main/packages/core#initializewithappid)
- [MobileCore.initialize(initOptions)](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-react-native/tree/main/packages/core#initialize)

> [!NOTE]  
> Starting from Adobe Experience Platform React native **7.x**,  there is no longer a need to initialize the SDK on the [native platforms](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-react-native/tree/main#initializing), as was required in earlier versions.

> [!NOTE] 
> The [link here](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-react-native/tree/main#initializing) is for users who want to refer back to the old registering instructions for Adobe Experience Platform React Native **6.x**.

## Importing the extension:
In your React Native application, import the core/lifecycle/signal/identity extension as follows:
```typescript
import { MobileCore, Lifecycle, Signal, LogLevel, PrivacyStatus, Event } from '@adobe/react-native-aepcore'
import {Edge, ExperienceEvent} from '@adobe/react-native-aepedge';
import {EdgeBridge} from '@adobe/react-native-aepedgebridge';
import {Consent} from "@adobe/react-native-aepedgeconsent";
import {Identity} from '@adobe/react-native-aepedgeidentity';
import {
  Messaging,
  MessagingDelegate,
  MessagingEdgeEventType,
  Message
} from '@adobe/react-native-aepmessaging';
import {
  Optimize,
  Offer,
  Proposition,
  DecisionScope,
} from "@adobe/react-native-aepoptimize";
import {
  Places,
  PlacesAuthStatus,
  PlacesGeofence,
  PlacesGeofenceTransitionType,
  PlacesLocation,
  PlacesPOI,
} from "@adobe/react-native-aepplaces";
import {
  Target,
  TargetOrder,
  TargetParameters,
  TargetPrefetchObject,
  TargetProduct,
  TargetRequestObject,
} from "@adobe/react-native-aeptarget";
import { UserProfile } from "@adobe/react-native-aepuserprofile";
import { Assurance } from "@adobe/react-native-aepassurance";
import { CampaignClassic } from "@adobe/react-native-aepcampaignclassic";
```

## Migration guide

See [migration.md](./docs/migration.md) for guidance on migrating from ACP React Native libraries.

## Troubleshooting and Known issues

1. Getting error when building on iOS Xcode

```xcode
Use of '@import' when C++ modules are disabled, consider using -fmodules and -fcxx-modules
```
Refer to the solution [here](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-react-native/issues/247#issuecomment-1642944117).

2. Getting error when building on iOS

```xcode
Underlying Objective-C module 'AEPRulesEngine' not found
```
Refer to the solution [here](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-react-native/issues/263#issuecomment-1498393770).
